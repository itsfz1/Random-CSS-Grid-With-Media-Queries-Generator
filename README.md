# Random CSS Grid With Media Queries Generator

A responsive random CSS grid generator for the confused and out of ideas developers. You can view, edit and copy the code from codepen. You can change the values to your taste by default the values are in rem and this page html `{font-size: 62.5%;}` is defined so `(1rem = 10px)` by default it would be `(1rem = 16px)`. Hope you find this generator somehow useful. **Thanks**.
